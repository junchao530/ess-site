Orpyx® plantar measurement technologies include wearable sensors used to create life-changing health tools and empower patients and practitioners through data analytics. Our platform enables a proxy feedback system. Orpyx is an anagram of proxy. Clever, huh?

Our flagship product, Orpyx SI® sensory insoles, empower people with diabetes to maintain mobility by helping prevent diabetic foot ulcers and limb loss through advanced pressure, temperature and movement sensor technology and analytics. Orpyx SI sensory insoles are a patented, Class II Exempt system that is registered with the FDA and Health Canada.

We truly believe that the best treatment plan for diabetic foot ulcers is to prevent them from happening in the first place.
