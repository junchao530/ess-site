The University of Calgary Society of Energy Engineers (SEE) is a department student club run by undergraduate students with the fundamental purpose of creating a diverse, technical, and connected student workforce. The Society of Energy Engineers was found in 2016 by Energy Engineering students to better their university experience. We believe that by equipping our students with a solid foundation of engineering principals, knowledge, experience, and networking skills, they will gain a competitive advantage when entering any industry. We host events, mixers, international trips, and much more! We will have great collaboration events with other clubs that will be the biggest at the Schulich Engineering. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact at:
