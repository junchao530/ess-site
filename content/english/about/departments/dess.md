The Digital Engineering Students’ Society (DESS) is a student run organization that aims to represent students enrolled in the Digital Engineering Minor program. The Digital Minor allows students without a software engineering background to learn more about upcoming technology and computer programming skills. With the world advancing technologically, DESS and the Digital Minor work to equip individuals with programming skills to complement their major. We wish to represent these students providing platforms to enhance their knowledge and network with professionals and other like-minded individuals. DESS’ mission is to provide students with the means to gain out of classroom experiences applicable to the industry and learn what they can achieve using computer programming.
